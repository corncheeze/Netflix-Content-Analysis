## Summary of Project
Project Overview:
The project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's extensive content library, encompassing movies and TV series using SQL and Tablaeu. This analysis aims to understand viewing habits, content evolution, and regional strategies, providing valuable insights for Netflix and the broader entertainment industry.

`Part I - Data Collection`
Data was sourced from Kaggle's Netflix dataset, which includes information such as show ID, type, title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, genres, and description. The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of Netflix's collection, crucial for analyzing content trends and performance.

`Part II - Data Cleaning`
To ensure the dataset's accuracy and completeness, a comprehensive data cleaning process was conducted using SQL. Null values were handled through imputation or removal, duplicates were identified and eliminated, and missing rows were populated where necessary. Irrelevant columns were dropped to refine the dataset, and columns were split into more granular segments for improved analysis.

`Part III - Data Exploration/Visualization`
I conducted a thorough analysis and visualization of Netflix's content. I began by examining the distribution of content types, revealing that movies constitute 69.69% of the library while TV series make up 30.31%, indicating a strategic emphasis on films. I then explored the geographic distribution of content production, using maps to show popularity by country, with the United States being a significant content consumer. Next, I analyzed annual release trends from 2009 to 2022, noting a steady increase until 2018, followed by a decline in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, I examined the distribution of content by viewer ratings, finding that TV-MA-rated content is the most prevalent, highlighting a focus on adult audiences.
